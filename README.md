# Mech 105 Functions

## This branch contains three folders each containing a README.md, and a .m file for Matlab functions each concerning numerical methods.

### False Position Function
#### This function estimates the roots of a funtion using a lower and upper estimate of where the root might be (so it is a closed method). This function takes some time to run and is not very computationally effecient, however, it will always give you a very good estimate of where the actual root is (assuming the upper and lower guess were reasonably close to the actual root).

### LU Factorization Function
#### This function allows the user to generate a Lower and Upper Triangular Matrix for any given square matrix [A].The function uses partial pivoting.  *note: matrix [A] must be a square matrix for this function to work properly.

### Simpson's Function
